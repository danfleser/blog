==============================

## 1. Adding console logs to render expressions

If you wanna log the props to an expression style component but can’t be bothered to convert it, put the log in parentheses then add chopsticks `||`:

/>

Note. you have to use the _or_ operator because console.log returns undefined.

## 2. Trace a function’s call with the Error object

If you’ve no idea where a function’s being called from, log an `Error` object in it and you’ll get a stack trace in the console:

## 3. Ternary question marks

Want to write more ternary question marks? Most people know that using `||` and `&&` is a super quick way of writing conditions, but did you know there’s a `??` as well?

This says, if `state?.bookings` is undefined return `{}`.
