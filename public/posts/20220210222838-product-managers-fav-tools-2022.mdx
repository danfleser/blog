# [Slack](http://slack.com)

Really does take the cake when it comes to company wide communication.
Integrations and automations (Zoom, Around, Linear, Figma, etc) to make things easier to view, monitor, and/or take action on.

It’s the most powerful and effective tool I use every single day.

# [Zoom](http://zoom.us)

The easiest and most reliable video/audio conferencing software I’ve ever used, period.

# [Notion](http://notion.so)

I quickly realized Notion is one of the most flexible “productivity” apps that I’ve ever used — one piece of software to take meeting notes, write requirements, connect pieces of data between pages and tables, and much more. I use Notion multiple times a day and actually look forward to the experience.

# [Otter.ai](http://otter.ai)

Interesting tool that helps me record (audio only) and transcribe important meetings.

# [Hotjar](https://www.hotjar.com/)

Allows for playback session of users sessions and makes it extremely easy to gather feedback from actual users.

# [Linear](http://linear.app)

The better task management tools I’ve used in my PM career — I call it JIRA’s hipster, younger brother. It’s straightforward and makes sense to track software development projects, software bugs, roadmaps, etc.

# [Whimsical](https://whimsical.com/)

My preferred tool for wireframing, process documentation, prototyping, etc. It’s extremely simple while remaining wildly flexible and collaborative.

A good project manager also has to have a standing desk.
