Life is busy. If you don’t purposefully carve time out every day to progress and improve.

- You are the designer of your destiny.
- You are responsible.

With this short morning routine, your life will quickly change.

- Wake up
- Get in the zone
- Get moving
- Put the right food in your body
- Get ready
- Get inspired
- Get perspective
- Do something to move you forward

# 1\. Get A Healthy 7+ Hours of Sleep

Let’s face it — Sleep is just as important as eating and drinking water. Despite this, millions of people do not sleep enough and experience insane problems as a result.

Getting a healthy amount of sleep is linked to:

- Increased memory
- Longer life
- Decreased inflammation
- Increased creativity
- Increased attention and focus
- Decreased fat and increased muscle mass with exercise
- Lower stress
- Decreased dependence on stimulants like caffeine
- Decreased risk of getting into accidents
- Decreased risk of depression
- And tons more… google it.

# 2\. Meditation Facilitate Clarity and Abundance

Meditation facilitate intense gratitude for all that you have. Gratitude is having an abundance mindset. When you think abundantly, the world is your oyster. There is limitless opportunity and possibility for you.

What you think you become. People are magnets. When you’re grateful for what you have, you will attract more of the positive and good. Gratitude is contagious.

# 3\. Hard Physical Activity

Whatever your preference, get your body moving.

If you want to be among the healthy, happy, and productive people in the world, get in the habit of regular exercise. Many people go immediately to the gym to get their body moving. I have lately found that doing yard work in the wee hours of the morning generates an intense inflow of inspiration and clarity.

Exercise has been found to decrease your chance of depression, anxiety, and stress. It is also related to higher success in your career.

# 4\. Take A Cold Shower

Cold water immersion radically facilitates physical and mental wellness. When practiced regularly, it provides long-lasting changes to your body’s immune, lymphatic, circulatory and digestive systems that improve the quality of your life. It can also increase weight-loss because it boosts your metabolism.

# 5\. Listen to/Read Uplifting Content

It is common for the world’s most successful people to read at least one book per week. They are constantly learning.

Over a long enough period of time you’ll think and see the world differently. You’ll be able to make more connections between different topics.

# 6\. Review Your Life Vision

Your goals should be written down — short term and long term. Taking just a few minutes to read your life vision puts your day into perspective.

If you read your long term goals every day you will think about them every day. If you think about them every day, and spend your days working toward them, they’ll manifest.

Achieving goals is a science. There’s no confusion or ambiguity to it. If you follow a simple pattern, you can accomplish all of your goals, no matter how big they are.

A fundamental aspect of that is writing them down and reviewing them every single day.

# 8\. Eat that Frog! Do At Least One Thing Towards Long-Term Goals

_The worst comes first._ You need to do the hard stuff first thing in the morning.

If you take just one step toward you big goals every day, you’ll realize those goals weren’t really far away.

# Conclusion

After you’ve done this, no matter what you have for the rest of your day, you’ll have done the important stuff first. You’ll have put yourself in a place to succeed.

Because you’ll have done all these things, you’ll show up better in life. You’ll be better at your job. You’ll be better in your relationships. You’ll be happier. You’ll be more confident. You’ll be more bold and daring. You’ll have more clarity and vision.

Your life will shortly change.
