## Which tech stack to use

MEAN is an open source, high-level, **Javascript-based stack** best used for building dynamic websites and applications.

The layers of MEAN are:

- [**MongoDB**](https://www.mongodb.com/): A NoSQL database that uses binary JSON documents with schema.
- [**Express.js**](https://expressjs.com/): A modular web application framework for Node.js.
- [**AngularJS**](https://angularjs.org/): A client-side application framework used to build end-user interfaces separate from the business logic. Can also be replaced with similar popular frontend frameworks like React or Vue.
- [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en/): An application runtime environment that represents the “JavaScript everywhere” paradigm that MEAN is known for.

Used by Netflix, Paypal, The Weather Channel, and Forbes.

**Pros**

- All tools are open source and use JavaScript, allowing for full-stack development.
- Great performance for SPAs.
- Usable on any operating system.

**Cons**

- Hard to adopt into existing architectures that don't use JavaScript.
- Risk losing data during heavy workflows.
- Maintenance can be a hassle, frequent updates and changes.

## MERN

The MERN stack is a variation on MEAN that replaces Angular with [React](https://reactjs.org/).

<img src="/images/react-mern.png" alt="MERN stack" />

**Pros**

- Build a simple to intermediate single-page application in the quickest time possible.
- Optimized for SPAs.
- There are more React developers than Angular developers.

**Cons**

- Sacrificing some functionality without a full framework

## MEVN

Similar to MERN, MEVN replaces Angular with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).

**Pros**

- Faster performance than React and Angular
- Ready to go right out of the box
- Cost-effective due to simplicity to use

**Cons**

- Might lack some resources, as is the least popular of the three frameworks
- Scalability is not a big plus so don’t plan to add any fancy application features.

LAMP is the world’s **most popular tech stack**, designed to build applications without reliance on external software or data.

The layers of LAMP are

- [**Linux**](https://www.linux.org/): An open source, Unix-like operating system consisting of a package management system around a Linux kernel.
- [**Apache web server**](https://httpd.apache.org/): A highly popular and fully-featured web server, used by 54% of all sites on the web.
- [**MySQL**](https://www.mysql.com/): A multithreaded SQL relational database management system built for at-scale use.
- [**PHP**](https://www.php.net/): A server-side scripting language designed for web development.

**Pros**

- Widespread support for each technology in the stack.
- Mature stack with a wealth of previous solutions and customizations to draw from.
- Non-blocking structure makes it easy to scale and faster to develop.
- LAMP is fully open source.
- PHP and MySQL are easy to learn and work with.

**Cons**

- Limited to only Linux operating system.
- Difficult to switch between backend and frontend tools.
- Projected to decline in use over time due to the prevalence of JavaScript and the cloud.

## Serverless

Nowdays companies shift from managing their own app infrastructure to instead building cloud-native serverless applications.

**Pros**

- Perfect for small startup that cannot afford to hire a full team to manage your application’s tech stack
- Cost-effective for small businesses and startups.
- No need to manage or maintain your own technologies.

**Cons**

- Less control over what technologies are in the stack.
- Scaling costs will make this ineffective beyond a certain size.

How do you choose?

**You’ll want to consider**

- What type of app will it be? Cloud-based, hybrid, etc.?
- What is the expected lifetime of this application?
- What technologies are available in my client’s infrastructure? Will it be standardized or varied?
- How much traffic will your application need to handle? Does the traffic happen in spikes or steady flow?
- How dynamic will your application be? Will it update in real time?
- How much retraining will your team need to do?
- How much maintenance do you want to allocate to the application?

As a general rule, MEAN is better for smaller-scale modern applications, like progressive web apps, cloud-based applications, or single-page applications. LAMP is better for larger-scale applications that prioritize uptime and availability.
