description: "When using asynchronous communication for Microservices, it is common to use a message broker. A broker ensures communication between different microservices is reliable and stable, that the messages are managed and monitored within the system and that messages don’t get lost."

# You should consider a few things:

- Broker Scale — The number of messages sent per second in the system.
- Data Persistency — The ability to recover messages.
- Consumer Capability — Whether the broker is capable of managing one-to-one and/or one-to-many consumers.

# RabbitMQ (AMQP)

- **Scale**: based on configuration and resources, the ballpark here is around 50K msg per second.
- **Persistency**: both persistent and transient messages are supported.
- **One-to-one** vs **one-to-many consumers**: both.

# Kafka

- **Scale**: can send up to a million messages per second.
- **Persistency**: yes.
- **One-to-one** vs **one-to-many consumers**: only one-to-many.

# Redis

- **Scale**: can send up to a million messages per second.
- **Persistency**: basically, no — it’s an in-memory datastore.
- **One-to-one** vs **one-to-many consumers**: both.

# Use Cases

- Short-lived Messages: Redis
- Large Amounts of Data: Kafka
- Complex Routing: RabbitMQ
