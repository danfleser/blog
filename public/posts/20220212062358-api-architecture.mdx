# 1\. Learn the basics of [HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview)

- HTTP has **verbs** (actions or methods): GET, POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE are most common.
- REST is **resource-oriented** and a resource is represented by an **URI**: `/library/`
- An **endpoint** is the combination of a verb and an URI, example: `GET: /books/`
- An endpoint can be interpreted as an _action performed on a resource_**_._** Example: `POST: /books/` may mean "Create a new book".
- At a high-level, **verbs map to CRUD operations**: `GET` means `Read`, `POST` means `Create`, `PUT` and `PATCH` mean `Update`, and `DELETE` means `Delete`
- A response’s status is specified by its **status code**: `1xx` for **information**, `2xx` for **success**, `3xx` for **redirection**, `4xx` for **client errors** and `5xx` for **server errors**

# 2\. Do not return plain text

Most REST APIs by convention use JSON as the data format.

You should still **specify the** `**Content-Type: application/json**` **header.**

# 3\. Do not use verbs in URIs

\# Don’t do this
GET: /books/:slug/getBook/
\# Do this
GET: /books/:slug

\# Don’t do this
POST: /books/createNewBook/
\# Do this
POST: /books/

This is because the **HTTP verbs should be sufficient to accurately describe the action being performed on the resource**.

# 4\. Use plural nouns for resources

**My personal advice is to _use the plural form_.**

GET: /books/2/
POST: /books/
...

# 5\. Return the error details in the response body

When an API server handles an error, it is convenient (\*and recommended\*) to return **error details** within the JSON body to **help consumers with debugging**. Even better if you include which fields were affected by the error!

{
"error": "Invalid payload.",
"detail": {
"name": "This field is required."
}
}

# 6\. Pay special attention to HTTP status codes

> _The worst thing your API could do is_ return an error response _with a_ `_200 OK_` _status code._

**Make use of the HTTP status code, and use the response body to provide error details**.

HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/json{
"error": "Expected at least three items in the list."
}

# 7\. You should use HTTP status codes consistently

GET: 200 OK
PUT: 200 OK
POST: 201 Created
PATCH: 200 OK
DELETE: 204 No Content


# 8\. Make use of the querystring for filtering and pagination

Your consumers may want to retrieve items that fulfill a specific condition, or retrieve them in small amounts at a time to improve performance.

With **filtering**, consumers can specify parameters (or properties) that the returned items should have.

**Pagination** allows consumers to retrieve _fractions of the set of data_. The simplest kind of pagination is **page number pagination**, which is determined by a `page` and a `page_size`.

GET: /books?page=1&page_size=10

\# Don’t do this
GET: /books/published/
\# Do this
GET: /books?published=true&page=2&page_size=10

# 9\. Do not nest resources

My personal recommendation is to **use query string parameters** to filter the `books` resource directly:

GET: /books?author=Dan

And this clearly means: “Get all books for author name Dan”

# 10\. Know the difference between `401 Unauthorized` and `403 Forbidden`

- Has the consumer not provided authentication credentials? Was their SSO Token invalid/timed out? 👉 `401 Unauthorized`.
- Was the consumer _correctly authenticated_, but they _don’t have the required permissions/proper clearance_ to access the resource? 👉 `403 Forbidden`.
