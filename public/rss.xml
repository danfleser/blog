### 1. Choose a language

You need to start slow. Practice as much as possible.

### 2. Understand a programming concept

If you don’t remember the syntax that’s fine, use Google to find answers.

### 3. Use online tutorials

You get multiple perspectives. It helps you learn faster and more efficiently.

### 4. Dedicate hours for learning every day in your calendar

Read blogs. Keep learning new things and use what you learned by building something useful.

### 5. Practice, Practice, Practice!

The saying “_practice makes perfect_” is very true if you’re willing to put in the time to be great at something.

### 6. Don’t give up

One key to becoming a good coder is to never give up.

### 7. Don’t reinvent the wheel

Not every solution needs to be built from scratch, use existing libraries.

### 8. Work on your soft skills

Practice writing, It helps you in the long run and will help you stand out from the rest.

### 9. Build a strong portfolio of projects

Learn + Build things, a win-win situation.

### 10. Document Your Journey

Write blog posts. Many people who are starting their journey today, are definitely going to be inspired by your writings.

### 11. Earn while you learn

### 12. Define small goals

Take one thing at a time, this is the ultimate confidence booster.

### 13. Don’t be afraid to ask for help

Don’t feel shy to ask even if you have silly questions. Use [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).

### 14. Challenge yourself

Don’t compete with others, compete with yourself.

### 15. Learn the basics and build small applications

Powerful foundation = 20+ small applications. Keep track in a github repo.

### 16. Refuse negative talk

Remember programmers never quit, there is always a workaround. Take a break and bounce back stronger.

### 17. Remember nobody is born a pro

Consistency, hard work and giving your best shot will make you a pro.

### 18. Nothing works unless you do

Practice makes a man perfect.

### 19. Focus on the process, not the outcome

If you have a solid foundation, the rest is easy to crack.

Live web development is a new and emerging source of income for web developers with the right skills.

Real-time live demonstrations of building web applications can be a very engaging experience for beginner developers who try to learn how to build web applications.

The goal is to show developers what the end-product should look like but also to help & engage them in their journey towards becoming great software engineers.

Earn money from live coding, teaching other people how to code, or simply showing your skills in front of thousands of people.

In this video series, I share the best ways and how to increase your money income as a web developer while working from home.

## Which tech stack to use

MEAN is an open source, high-level, **Javascript-based stack** best used for building dynamic websites and applications.

<img src="/images/mean.png" alt="MEAN stack" />

The layers of MEAN are:

- [**MongoDB**](https://www.mongodb.com/): A NoSQL database that uses binary JSON documents with schema.
- [**Express.js**](https://expressjs.com/): A modular web application framework for Node.js.
- [**AngularJS**](https://angularjs.org/): A client-side application framework used to build end-user interfaces separate from the business logic. Can also be replaced with similar popular frontend frameworks like React or Vue.
- [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en/): An application runtime environment that represents the “JavaScript everywhere” paradigm that MEAN is known for.

Used by Netflix, Paypal, The Weather Channel, and Forbes.

**Pros**

- All tools are open source and use JavaScript, allowing for full-stack development.
- Great performance for SPAs.
- Usable on any operating system.

**Cons**

- Hard to adopt into existing architectures that don't use JavaScript.
- Risk losing data during heavy workflows.
- Maintenance can be a hassle, frequent updates and changes.

## MERN

The MERN stack is a variation on MEAN that replaces Angular with [React](https://reactjs.org/).

<img src="/images/react-mern.png" alt="MERN stack" />

**Pros**

- Build a simple to intermediate single-page application in the quickest time possible.
- Optimized for SPAs.
- There are more React developers than Angular developers.

**Cons**

- Sacrificing some functionality without a full framework

## MEVN

Similar to MERN, MEVN replaces Angular with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).

**Pros**

- Faster performance than React and Angular
- Ready to go right out of the box
- Cost-effective due to simplicity to use

**Cons**

- Might lack some resources, as is the least popular of the three frameworks
- Scalability is not a big plus so don’t plan to add any fancy application features.

LAMP is the world’s **most popular tech stack**, designed to build applications without reliance on external software or data.

The layers of LAMP are

- [**Linux**](https://www.linux.org/): An open source, Unix-like operating system consisting of a package management system around a Linux kernel.
- [**Apache web server**](https://httpd.apache.org/): A highly popular and fully-featured web server, used by 54% of all sites on the web.
- [**MySQL**](https://www.mysql.com/): A multithreaded SQL relational database management system built for at-scale use.
- [**PHP**](https://www.php.net/): A server-side scripting language designed for web development.

**Pros**

- Widespread support for each technology in the stack.
- Mature stack with a wealth of previous solutions and customizations to draw from.
- Non-blocking structure makes it easy to scale and faster to develop.
- LAMP is fully open source.
- PHP and MySQL are easy to learn and work with.

**Cons**

- Limited to only Linux operating system.
- Difficult to switch between backend and frontend tools.
- Projected to decline in use over time due to the prevalence of JavaScript and the cloud.

## Serverless

Nowdays companies shift from managing their own app infrastructure to instead building cloud-native serverless applications.

**Pros**

- Perfect for small startup that cannot afford to hire a full team to manage your application’s tech stack
- Cost-effective for small businesses and startups.
- No need to manage or maintain your own technologies.

**Cons**

- Less control over what technologies are in the stack.
- Scaling costs will make this ineffective beyond a certain size.

How do you choose?

**You’ll want to consider**

- What type of app will it be? Cloud-based, hybrid, etc.?
- What is the expected lifetime of this application?
- What technologies are available in my client’s infrastructure? Will it be standardized or varied?
- How much traffic will your application need to handle? Does the traffic happen in spikes or steady flow?
- How dynamic will your application be? Will it update in real time?
- How much retraining will your team need to do?
- How much maintenance do you want to allocate to the application?

As a general rule, MEAN is better for smaller-scale modern applications, like progressive web apps, cloud-based applications, or single-page applications. LAMP is better for larger-scale applications that prioritize uptime and availability.
