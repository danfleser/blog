Create a new `components` folder with a `Layout.js`, `Header.js` and `Footer.js` files.\r\n\r\n`components/Layout.js`\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nexport default function Header() {\r\n  return (\r\n    <header className=\"app-header\">\r\n      <div className=\"app-container\">\r\n        <div className=\"content\">\r\n          <Link href=\"/\" passHref>\r\n            <h2 className=\"logo\">Dev blog</h2>\r\n          </Link>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </header>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`components/Header.js`\r\nxxx\r\n\r\n`components/Footer.js`\r\nxxx\r\n\r\nNext letâ€™s create a sample markdown file for a blog post. This along with all subsequent blog post markdown files will need to be saved inside a new `posts` folder.\r\n\r\n`posts/hello-world.md`\r\nxxx\r\n\r\nThe images folder for the thumbnails should be located within the `public` folder in the root of the application.\r\n\r\nCreate a couple more files like this and then weâ€™re ready to create a `Post.js` component thatâ€™ll display a preview for each of blog posts on the homepage.\r\n\r\n`components/Post.js`\r\nxxx\r\n\r\nNow we parse the static markdown file(title, excerpt, create data, thumbnail), loop over them and display post previews.\r\n\r\nNow to start pulling everything together by updating the `pages/index.js` file as follows:\r\n\r\nNow all thatâ€™s left it to create the file to display the individual blog posts.\r\n\r\n`pages/blog/[slug].js`\r\nxxx\r\n\r\nYou should now have a functioning blog using Next.js which you can easily add new posts using markdown files.\r\n"},"nextPost":null},"__N_SSG":true}
