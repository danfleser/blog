In Node.js we have \",mdx(\"strong\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"node-cache\"),\" and \",mdx(\"strong\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"memory-cache\"),\" as some great libraries to handle memory cache in a Node server.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Distributed Cache\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"In this caching technique we combine the memory of multiple networks into a single memory data store which we later use as the final data cache to prove fast access to the data. This technique is especially used in a high volume of data and a huge number of network calls at the same time allows incremental expansion and scaling by adding more server memory to the cluster.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Socket.io\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"There is a lot when it comes to understanding real-time communication in Socket.IO if you are just getting started as a backend developer, the main logic behind real-time communication stands between the \",mdx(\"strong\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"client\"),\" and the \",mdx(\"strong\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"server.\"),\" It allows the flow of \",mdx(\"strong\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"bi-directional\"),\" data between the client & server, you can think of bi-directional data flow as the synchronous flow of data between two terminals to achieve the real-time communication behavior, these types of behavior are enabled when the client has Socket.IO in the browser along with the server integrated with Socket.IO package. And the data can be sent in the form of \",mdx(\"strong\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"JSON\"),\" requests.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"REST\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Before REST, APIs were developed around a remote procedure call (RPC) and the APIs looked like some locally executed code. Many technologies tried to solve this problem using RPC-like stacks to hide the root problem and after that REST was introduced to build web-based APIs in a better way.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"In REST the architecture is styled with simple HTTP calls to communicate instead of complex options like \",mdx(\"strong\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"COBRA, COM+, RPC\"),\". In REST the calls are messages based and rely on the \",mdx(\"em\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"HTTP\"),\" standards to describe these messages. In the \",mdx(\"strong\",{parentName:\"p\"},mdx(\"em\",{parentName:\"strong\"},\"Node.js\")),\" ecosystem, you can go for the \",mdx(\"strong\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"node-rest-client\"),\" and \",mdx(\"strong\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"Axios\"),\", both serve pretty good service for faster web applications.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"GraphQL\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"A great alternative to REST, GraphQL uses the APIs that prioritize giving clients exactly the data they request. A flexible and developer-friendly alternative, as you can deploy it even in an IDE known as \",mdx(\"strong\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"GraphiQL.\"),\" You also get the advantages to add or deprecate fields without impacting existing \",mdx(\"strong\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"queries\"),\" and build APIs with whatever method is preferred.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Unit Testing Frameworks\"),mdx(\"p\",null,mdx(\"strong\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"Jest:\"),\" A very popular testing framework known for its simplicity and developed by \",mdx(\"strong\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"Facebook\"),\". Among all the testing frameworks Jest has the best documentation with parallel testing support, which means that you can run each test in their own process to maximize performance.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,mdx(\"strong\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"Mocha:\"),\" It serves the old standards of Unit Testing frameworks for Node applications and supports async operations like callbacks, promises with highly extensible and customizable assertions.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,mdx(\"strong\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"Chai:\"),\" It can be used alongside Mocha and can be used as a \",mdx(\"strong\",{parentName:\"p\"},mdx(\"em\",{parentName:\"strong\"},\"TDD/BDD\")),\" assertion library for Node.js that can be paired with any testing framework based on \",mdx(\"strong\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"JavaScript\"),\".\"))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n","scope":{}}}},"__N_SSG":true}
