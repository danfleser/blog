YouTube is a great platform where you can make money by making videos on different topics or about things that you know or are passionate about.

If you're a web developer and know how to educate others on how to build websites, then it's time for you to start earning money by running a Youtube Channel.

The process is simple:
Create interesting content for the viewers.
Post your videos regularly & share them with your audience on social media.
Once, you'll start getting love from the audience in the shape of subscribers, likes & views. You can then monetize your channel from google AdSense, bring sponsors & do affiliate marketing.

In this video series, I share the best ways and how to increase your money income as a web developer while working from home.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this tutorial weâ€™ll be building a blog using React and Next.js.

Each post of this blog is written in markdown file.

Starting this blog from scratch was a great learning experience and didn't take too long to build(2 days).

Letâ€™s get started by creating a new Next.js application:

    npx create-next-app next-md-blog

Weâ€™ll also need a couple of dependencies so letâ€™s go ahead and install those as well:

    npm install gray-matter marked

- `gray-matter` â€“ Parses front-matter from markdown files.
- `marked` â€“ Compiles markdown into HTML.

Next letâ€™s create a layout component thatâ€™ll load a global header and footer as is common practice when building a blog or websites in general. Create a new `components` folder with a `Layout.js`, `Header.js` and `Footer.js` files.

`components/Layout.js`

```jsx
export default function Header() {
  return (
    <header className="app-header">
      <div className="app-container">
        <div className="content">
          <Link href="/" passHref>
            <h2 className="logo">Dev blog</h2>
          </Link>
        </div>
      </div>
    </header>
  );
}
```

`components/Header.js`
xxx

`components/Footer.js`
xxx

Next letâ€™s create a sample markdown file for a blog post. This along with all subsequent blog post markdown files will need to be saved inside a new `posts` folder.

`posts/hello-world.md`
xxx

The images folder for the thumbnails should be located within the `public` folder in the root of the application.

Create a couple more files like this and then weâ€™re ready to create a `Post.js` component thatâ€™ll display a preview for each of blog posts on the homepage.

`components/Post.js`
xxx

Now we parse the static markdown file(title, excerpt, create data, thumbnail), loop over them and display post previews.

Now to start pulling everything together by updating the `pages/index.js` file as follows:

Now all thatâ€™s left it to create the file to display the individual blog posts.

`pages/blog/[slug].js`
xxx

You should now have a functioning blog using Next.js which you can easily add new posts using markdown files.
