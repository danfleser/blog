# 4\. Use Wild Cards in Your Search Term

When you use an asterisk (\*) in the search terms, this acts as a placeholder that Google automatically fills before delivering the results.

# 6\. Search a Website Using Google

Did you know that you can search inside a website using Google? With this feature, you can find articles, blog posts, and pages published on a particular site — especially when it doesn’t have a built-in search feature available.

# 7\. Gradually Increase the Words in Your Search Term

Google recommends that you start a search with only the basic search terms. For example, if you are trying to find courses for learning Javascript, start with the most basic phrase and gradually increase the number of words in your search term until you find what you are looking for:

- JavaScript courses
- JavaScript courses for beginners
- JavaScript courses for beginners Youtube

Following this searching strategy has a few benefits. Using a broader search term first gives you the chance to see the big picture of the topic and the different avenues available to take. It also ensures that you don’t miss any important information by going straight to a refined, focused search term. As you add more words to the search term, you get to see results that are more targeted to your specific needs.
