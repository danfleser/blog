> Programming is a basic human skill, just like reading, writing and arithmetic. Anyone can learn to program with time and effort.

# 1. Lack of curiosity

If you lack curiosity about computers and how technology works, you will never be successful as a programmer.

**Find Your Curiosity:** Ask yourself if programming truly interests you. If your honest answer is that it doesn‚Äôt, go find something that you are interested in. Save yourself the time and energy. But if your answer is ‚ÄúYes‚Äù, then push yourself find something new that you haven‚Äôt noticed before, recognize the vast ocean and dive a little deeper.

# 2. Lack of autonomy and resourcefulness

If you don‚Äôt develop the ability to solve problems for yourself, you will never be successful as a programmer.

In the world of development, all the information you need is found in that magical place formerly known as the _Information Super Highway_. This massive library has one huge doorway: [Google](https://www.google.com).

Check this article [7 Tricks To Master the Art of Googling](http://localhost:3000/posts/20220212095550-master-the-art-of-googling) to unlock TOP SECRET ancient googling skills that the masters of the universe have used.

**Use the Resources:** Recognize that all the answers you need really are out there. When you have a question, force yourself to google it before asking someone else for the answer and check the documentation. Save the time of others for when you have tried and truly failed to find the answer you need.

# 3. Lack of persistence in the face of a problem

If you give up easily in the face of problems, you will never be successful as a programmer.

**Patient Acceptance:** You need to recognize that problems come with the territory and are not problems, but in fact challenges. Every challenge you face and overcome gives you deeper understanding and a better ability to face new challenges, and quickly resolve old ones.

# 4. No feeling of success in overcoming a problem

If you don‚Äôt feel a sense of excitement and accomplishment after solving a problem, you will never be successful as a programmer.

**Celebrate Your Wins:** Whenever you solve a problem that you struggled with, no matter how small, always take pride in your accomplishment, take a break and congratulate yourself for a job well done. Let the feeling of success sink in and energize you for the next problem you face.

# 5. Impatient about learning and understanding

If you are impatient about learning and expect to master everything quickly and effortlessly, you will never truly be successful at programming.

**Acknowledge Your Progress:** There is a lot to learn, and the journey of programming never ends. But the knowledge is cumulative, so take pride it what you do know, and trust that every effort you take in your learning will create a strong foundation of knowledge for wherever your career takes you.

# 6. Getting bored/tired from thinking

If you are lazy in your thinking and see concentrated, focused thinking as a chore, you will never truly be successful at programming.

**Your Mind is a Muscle:** Trust that your brain is like a muscle ‚Äî as you use it, it gets better and more efficient in it‚Äôs thinking. As you put pieces together and develop mental concepts, it becomes much easier to discover solutions.

# 7. Inability to think for yourself

If you expect others to think for you, and are unwilling to look at the details of your own situation, you will never be a truly successful programmer.

**Think for yourself:** Through your experience and critical thinking skills, develop your own perspectives. Make reasonable guesses, take a position, and be willing to change as new information comes to light.

# 8. Rigid, narrow and/or disorganized thinking

If you are rigid in your thinking, and you have difficulty keeping your code organized ‚Äî and by extension your thoughts organized and focused, you will never be successful at programming.

**Self Reflection:** You need to take a step back, and look at the bigger picture of how you are approaching things. How can you do this better? Is there anything you can do to make your life easier? What are you missing that could help you?

# 9. Needing the ‚Äúright‚Äù answer instead of recognizing a spectrum of ‚Äúgood‚Äù and ‚Äúbad‚Äù answers

If you see the end goal of programming as finding the right solution, rather than a spectrum of solutions, you will never truly be successful as a programmer.

**Get Creative:** Recognize that there are numerous ways to solve a problem, and through experience and exposure, you will develop a nuanced understanding overtime about which solutions feel better than others. Looking at the big picture, imagining different possibilities and trusting your gut will lead to better solutions that are more satisfying.

# 10. Not paying careful attention to details

If you gloss over details, and overlook little things, you will never be a truly successful programmer.

**Pay Attention to the Details:** The details matter and you have to accept that. Once you do, you can begin to always be scanning your code for anything that is out of place. You can organize your code and use tools that help you identify issues quickly.

# Conclusion

If you are interested in learning to program, I encourage you to begin the journey. Keep the above list in mind, and start exploring the many resources available online that can get you moving forward quickly. You won‚Äôt regret it.
