Does your HTML markup look like this üëÜ?

So you've made a delicious [div soup](https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/software-development/html5-web-components-overview)?, no problem. I'm here to help.

Writing [Semantic HTML](https://www.lifewire.com/why-use-semantic-html-3468271) gives your markup meaning to web browsers and screen readers and helps with SEO which brings your website on top of search engine results.

> ‚ÄúThe `div` element has no special meaning at all‚Ä¶Authors are strongly encouraged to view the `div` element as an element of last resort, for when no other element is suitable. Use of more appropriate elements instead of the `div` element leads to better accessibility for readers and easier maintainability for authors.‚Äù

# The `Main` Element

The `[main](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/main)` element indicates to browsers and screen readers which portion of your markup contains the main section of content on a given page. This can help with keyboard command access, zooming on mobile browsers, and more. It should be used only once per page.

```html
