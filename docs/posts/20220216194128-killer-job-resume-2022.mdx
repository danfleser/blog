Most people think that you need a diploma from Harvard or universities alike to be considered for a job in big tech companies. Although that may be partially true ([not always though, it seems Apple and Google no longer require you to have a college degree](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/16/15-companies-that-no-longer-require-employees-to-have-a-college-degree.html)).

There are CEOs out there looking for loyal people who know how to take orders without questioning, and are ready to do the work, day in and day out, because they need the paycheck at the end of the month.

# General tips

# 1. Make yourself relevant

Before sending your resume, always go through the job description a couple of times and try to understand what is relevant to the job you are applying for.

# 2. Never send a generic CV

You‚Äôll look like ‚Äú_just the next boring applicant in the list,_‚Äù and your chances of getting hired will be significantly reduced.

# 3. Speak to the point

- you need to present only the relevant stuff, the big picture, don‚Äôt get caught in details
- cut off the noise, don‚Äôt tell the client small details unless they ask for them
- just tell that the work is going well
- if there are some problems, mention them

# 4. Have a good Linkedin profile

# 5. Be Confident
