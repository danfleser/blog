If you‚Äôve never done any coding before, then HTML is a great place to start. It is the core building block of the Internet, and unlike most other languages, it gives learners immediate visual feedback on the code they are writing.

Git allows you to backup your files, keep track of changes, share your progress with other developers, and work on collaborative projects.

# **The Command Line**

The best way to use Git is via the ‚Äúterminal‚Äù or ‚Äúcommand line‚Äù, and this is also essential for modern web developers, allowing you to easily add 3rd party packages to your websites via [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/).

# Part 3: Building your skill set

# **Sass**

Sass is a CSS pre-processor. It takes basic CSS, and adds several new functionalities that make it better, easier to write, and easier to maintain. It‚Äôs also very easy to learn.

Start here:

- [sass-lang.com](https://sass-lang.com/guide)

# **Bootstrap**

Bootstrap is a component library, developed by Twitter. It allows developers to build prototypes _very_ quickly. Instead of custom coding that slider, or navbar, or accordion, Bootstrap can help you deploy one in seconds.

Start here:

- [Bootstrap examples](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/examples/)

# **React**

<img src="/images/20220218192724-react.png" alt="reactjs image" />

There are several modern JavaScript libraries out there, including Ember, React, Vue, and Angular. There‚Äôs no single right choice here, but after doing some research I chose to focus on React.

Of all these libraries and frameworks, React appears to be the most popular and fastest growing. It was developed by Facebook, and its approach to DOM manipulation also gives it an advantage over Angular.

# Part 4: Use your brain

Just start and don't let a day pass without learning something.
