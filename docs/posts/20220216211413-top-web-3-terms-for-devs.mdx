[**Blockchain**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp) ‚Äî decentralized ledger, that stores data across a network of computers (called **nodes**). The data is split into **blocks** that are linked using cryptography. When new data is pushed into the blockchain, it fills an empty block that is further linked to other blocks, creating a chronological order chain. The data in the blockchain is not revertable, it is stored forever, and anyone can view it.

[**Cryptocurrency**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cryptocurrency.asp) (‚Äú**crypto**‚Äù) ‚Äî a decentralized digital currency, created using cryptographic techniques.
